# String-Compression-Run-Length-Encoding-Advanced-Methods-
This project focuses on implementing different levels of string compression, from simple Run-Length Encoding (RLE) to pattern-based compression. Additionally, we will include decompression, case-sensitive handling, and compression efficiency analysis.
